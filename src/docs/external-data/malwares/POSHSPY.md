## Description

### MITRE Description

> [POSHSPY](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0150) is a backdoor that has been used by [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016) since at least 2015. It appears to be used as a secondary backdoor used if the actors lost access to their primary backdoors. (Citation: FireEye POSHSPY April 2017)
